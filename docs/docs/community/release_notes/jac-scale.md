# Jac-Scale Release Notes

This document provides a summary of new features, improvements, and bug fixes in each version of **Jac-Scale**. For details on changes that might require updates to your existing code, please refer to the [Breaking Changes](../breaking-changes.md) page.

## jac-scale 0.1.2 (Unreleased)

### PyPI Installation by Default

Kubernetes deployments now install Jaseci packages from PyPI by default instead of cloning the entire repository. This provides faster startup times and more reproducible deployments.

**Default behavior (PyPI installation):**

```bash
jac start app.jac --scale
```

**Experimental mode (repo clone - previous behavior):**

```bash
jac start app.jac --scale --experimental
```

### New CLI Flag: `--experimental`

Added `--experimental` (`-e`) flag to `jac start --scale` command. When enabled, falls back to the previous behavior of cloning the Jaseci repository and installing packages in editable mode. Useful for testing unreleased changes.

### Version Pinning via `plugin_versions` Configuration

Added `plugin_versions` configuration in `jac.toml` to pin specific package versions:

```toml
[plugins.scale.kubernetes.plugin_versions]
jaclang = "0.1.5"      # or "latest"
jac_scale = "0.1.1"    # or "latest"
jac_client = "0.1.0"   # or "latest"
jac_byllm = "none"     # use "none" to skip installation
```

When not specified, defaults to `"latest"` for all packages.

## jac-scale 0.1.1 (Latest Release)

## jac-scale 0.1.0

### Initial Release

First release of **Jac-Scale** - a scalable runtime framework for distributed Jac applications.

### Key Features

- Distributed runtime with load balancing and service discovery
- Intelligent walker scheduling across multiple nodes
- Auto-partitioned graph storage
- Performance monitoring and auto-scaling
- YAML-based configuration
- Username-based user management for authentication
- **Custom Response Headers**: Configure custom HTTP response headers via `[environments.response.headers]` in `jac.toml`. Useful for security headers like COOP/COEP (required for `SharedArrayBuffer` support in libraries like monaco-editor).

### Installation

```bash
pip install jac-scale
```
