//! Reentrancy + aliasing reference crate (Phase 0.0.2, rewritten in Phase S).
//!
//! This crate exposes the two opaque shapes the soundness guards exist to
//! exercise:
//!
//! 1. **Reentrancy** — a `&mut self` method (`Cell::apply`) invokes a
//!    `JacCallback` while its exclusive borrow is live.  If the Jac callback
//!    re-enters the SAME receiver (e.g. calls `bump`, another `&mut self` method,
//!    on the same handle), the generated shim would materialize a SECOND `&mut`
//!    from the same pointer: two live `&mut T`, instant UB.  The per-handle
//!    reentrancy guard (0.2.2) turns that second entry into a clean status-1
//!    error.  The crate itself carries no guard — it is the honest, dangerous
//!    shape the gate needs to catch.
//!
//! 2. **Aliasing (honestly shared)** — `Cell::alias(&self) -> CellAlias` mints a
//!    SECOND opaque wrapper over the SAME underlying counter.  Phase S rewrote
//!    this from the original `usize`-smuggled DOUBLE-OWN (two boxes each calling
//!    `Box::from_raw` on one address — a genuine double-free) into GENUINE shared
//!    ownership: the counter lives behind an `Arc<Mutex<i64>>`, and `alias`
//!    clones the `Arc`.  Two Jac wrappers, one refcounted inner: closing either
//!    wrapper drops only its `Arc` clone, and the counter is freed exactly once
//!    when the last clone drops.  This is the shape RC-safe handles (Phase S,
//!    Track A) make sound — `aliasing_conformance.jac` test 3 flips from a
//!    double-free abort to a clean result.
//!
//! `Mutex` also makes the shared inner `Send + Sync`, so the ABI's
//! `JacHandle<T>: Send` assertion holds without smuggling a raw pointer through
//! a `usize`.
//!
//! ABI NOTE (why the alias view is a distinct type, not `-> Self`).  The obvious
//! spelling is `Cell::alias(&self) -> Self`.  It compiles and works through the
//! CPython loader, but the *na* loader silently SKIPS it: because `Cell` has a
//! constructor (`new`), the synthesized na wrapper would need two same-arity
//! `init` overloads — the real `init(v: int)` and the adopt-ctor `init(raw: int)`
//! — which na cannot express (see `_synth.jac`, "na adopt-ctor signature clash").
//! A method may only return an opaque wrapper of a type that has NO constructor
//! (an "adoptable" type).  So the alias view is its own constructor-less type
//! `CellAlias`; it is reachable ONLY via `Cell::alias`, and shares `Cell`'s
//! `Arc`.  Two Jac wrappers, one refcounted object — the 0.0.2 shape, now sound.
